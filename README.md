## Motivation

I built my personal portfolio website to showcase my work and skills while learning new technologies like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. I also wanted to try out component libraries like Shadcn and Magic UI to create a sleek, modern design.

### Goal

The goal of this project was to create a dynamic portfolio website that automatically fetches my pinned GitHub projects, making it easier to keep my featured work up to date. I wanted a fast, responsive, and accessible site with a clean, modern design that highlights my skills and provides a seamless user experience.

## Features

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) App Router
- React Server Components (RSCs)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
  - Styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for headless component primitives
  - Icons from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/) and [Radix Icons](https://www.radix-ui.com/icons)
  - [Magic UI](https://magicui.design/) for animated components
- [Get Pinned Repos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-pinned-repos) to fetch pinned GitHub repositories easily
